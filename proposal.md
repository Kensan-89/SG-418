### Case Title
To-do task manager app called Things+.

### Background
Students conducting the online based bachelor program in logistics at Molde university usually combine school with a full-time job. A lot of people struggle to incorporate everyday tasks with school related requirements.

### Purpose
This app will pull data from primary Canvas to streamline deadlines and other tasks with your preferred calendar. The app will suggest a timeline and allocate a timeslot in your calendar based on data from Canvas, and Your own calendar inputs. Rather having to check multiple apps/websites, Things+ will streamline and gather all task in one place.

### Target Users
Students with fulltime jobs in addition to school, but for everyone using Canvas and the integrated calendar on your phone or laptop for planning purposes.

### Core Functionality

**Must Have (MVP)**
- Connectivity to Canvas (might be a challenge, but maybe we can use a dummy program to simulate dataflow from third-party programs).
- Seamless calendar integration with phone or laptop calendar.
- Timeline for tasks.
- Progress tracking.
- Strong privacy and security protocols.
- Tracking important dates (deadlines, exams).
- Tags for categories such as #IBE160, #household, #routines etc.

**Nice to Have (Optional Extensions)**
- Natural language model for speech to task functionality.
- Photo / screen shot recognition for task identification.
- Rating / Priority of tasks for timeline/time management.
- Summaries of updates since last check-in.

### Data Requirements
- Users: username, email, password.
- Calendar events: title, date/time, description, location, subject, participants.

### User Stories
1. As a full-time student with a full-time job, having just one app with that connects everything school related to my personal calendar is essential.
2. I work in rotations (turnus), and my available time for studying varies from week to week. My biggest challenge is time management.
3. My kids have multiple leisure activities that I need to juggle with work and school.

### Technical Constraints
- Must be able to pull data from the primary calendar in the users OS.
- Third-party data pull (Canvas).

### Success Criteria
- Calendar synchronization must be automatic.
- Trustworthy, the users can rely on the app for providing important information from Canvas.
- Easy to use. Speech to task for when you discover task and are unable to write them down.
