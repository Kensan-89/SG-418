**Story 1.5: Sync a Single Canvas Course**

As a logged-in user with a Canvas connection,
I want to sync assignments from a single Canvas course,
So that I can see my academic tasks alongside my personal tasks in the Agenda view.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. After connecting to Canvas, the user can select one of their courses to sync.
2. The application fetches assignments (name, due date, course name) from the selected course.
3. Fetched assignments are displayed in the "Agenda" view, alongside personal tasks.
4. Canvas assignments are clearly identifiable as such (e.g., with a specific icon or label).

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.3, Story 1.4
