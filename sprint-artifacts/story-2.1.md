**Story 2.1: Full Canvas Sync**

As a logged-in user with a Canvas connection,
I want the application to automatically sync all my courses and assignments,
So that my agenda is always up-to-date with my academic workload without manual intervention.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The application automatically fetches all active courses from the user's Canvas account.
2. It then fetches all upcoming assignments from those courses.
3. This synchronization happens periodically (e.g., every few hours) and can also be triggered manually.
4. New, updated, and deleted assignments in Canvas are reflected in the application after a sync.

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.5
