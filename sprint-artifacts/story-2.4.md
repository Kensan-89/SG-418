**Story 2.4: Unified Agenda View**

As a logged-in user,
I want to see my Canvas assignments, personal tasks, and Google Calendar events in a single, unified agenda,
So that I have a complete and holistic overview of all my commitments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The "Agenda" view now includes events from the user's selected Google Calendars.
2. All items (tasks, assignments, events) are sorted chronologically.
3. Each item type is visually distinct.
4. The view is performant and easy to read, even with many items.

**Prerequisites:** Story 2.1, Story 2.3
