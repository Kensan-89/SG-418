**Story 3.3: Define Preferred Study Times**

As a logged-in user,
I want to define my preferred study times (e.g., "early mornings," "evenings"),
So that the application can make more relevant suggestions for scheduling study sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A setting is available for users to specify their general availability and preferences for studying (e.g., days of the week, time ranges).
2. This information is saved to the user's profile.
3. The "Find Free Time" feature will use this information to rank its suggestions.

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.1
