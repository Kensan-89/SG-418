**Story 3.1: Task Prioritization**

As a logged-in user,
I want to set a priority level (e.g., high, medium, low) for my tasks,
So that I can visually distinguish and focus on what is most important.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Users can assign a priority level when creating or editing a task.
2. The priority level is visually represented in all task views (Agenda, Weekly, Today).
3. Users can filter or sort tasks by priority.

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.2
