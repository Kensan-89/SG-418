### 6. Wildcard Ideas (Post-MVP or for inspiration)

*A place for ideas that are outside the current MVP scope but could be interesting.*

- **Gamification:** Points for completing tasks on time? Streaks for daily usage?
- **Smart Suggestions:** "It looks like you have a big essay due in 2 weeks. Should I block out 3 study sessions for you?"
- **Focus Mode:** A timer feature (like Pomodoro) integrated with a task.
- **Collaboration:** Sharing a task list with a study group? (Probably out of scope for this project's core idea).


 1. Gamification

  The goal is to make productivity feel rewarding and build positive habits.

   * Streaks & Goals: Users could set a daily goal (e.g., "Complete 3 tasks"). The app
     would track their "streak" of consecutive days meeting this goal.
   * XP & Levels: Every completed task grants Experience Points (XP). Accumulating XP
     allows the user to "level up," providing a tangible sense of progression.
   * Achievements/Badges: Awarding badges for milestones like "Night Owl" (completing a
     task after midnight) or "Planner" (scheduling a task a week in advance).

     2. Proactive AI Assistant

  The goal is for the app to feel less like a tool and more like a personal assistant.

   * Task Decomposition: For large tasks, the AI could suggest breaking them down. "This
      'Final Research Paper' seems like a big project. Should I break it down into
     smaller steps for you?"
   * Energy-Based Scheduling: The app could learn the user's high/low energy times and
     suggest scheduling demanding tasks during their peak energy periods.
   * Clustering: The AI could notice several small, related tasks and suggest grouping
     them into a single, focused study block.

      3. Integrated Focus Mode

  *The goal is to help users not just plan their work, but *do* their work.*

   * Pomodoro Timer: A built-in Pomodoro timer (e.g., 25 minutes on, 5 off) that can be
     started for any task.
   * Distraction Blocking: Integration with system APIs or browser extensions to
     temporarily block distracting websites during a focus session.
   * Music Integration: Connect to Spotify or Apple Music to automatically start a
     "Focus" playlist when a session begins.

     4. Advanced Input Methods

  The goal is to make capturing tasks effortless.

   * Photo/Screenshot to Task: Use OCR and NLP to automatically create a task from a
     photo of a syllabus or a screenshot.
   * Email to Task: Allow users to forward emails to a unique address to automatically
     create tasks.

     5. Analytics & Burnout Prevention

  The goal is to provide users with insights into their own work habits.

   * Weekly Reports: Generate a weekly summary of productivity ("You completed 15 tasks
     and studied for 8 hours...").
   * Burnout Warning: If a user's schedule is packed for weeks with no breaks, the app
     could suggest scheduling downtime.
