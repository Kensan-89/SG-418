# Sprint 2 Plan: Core Functionality

**Sprint Goal:** Deliver a minimal but functional application with core user authentication and basic task management features.

**Selected Stories:**

*   **Story 1.1: User Authentication with Google**
    *   As a new user, I want to sign up and log in using my Google account, so that I can quickly and securely access the application without needing to create a new password.
*   **Story 1.2: Manual Task Creation**
    *   As a logged-in user, I want to manually create personal tasks, so that I can keep track of my to-do items.
*   **Story 1.3: Edit and Delete Personal Tasks**
    *   As a logged-in user, I want to edit and delete my personal tasks, so that I can manage and update my to-do list.
*   **Story 1.4: Mark Tasks as Complete**
    *   As a logged-in user, I want to mark tasks as complete, so that I can track my progress.
*   **Story 1.5: Micro-integration with Canvas**
    *   As a logged-in user, I want to connect to my Canvas account and sync a single course, so that I can see my assignments in the application.

**Notes:**

*   This sprint focuses on building the foundational features of the application.
*   Successful completion of this sprint will result in a usable application that can be tested by early users.
