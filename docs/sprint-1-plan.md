# Sprint 1 Plan: Project Foundation

**Sprint Goal:** Establish the core CI/CD pipeline to automate the build and test process, laying the groundwork for future development and deployment.

**Selected Stories:**

*   **Story 0.1: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (Completed)**
    *   **As a developer, I want a CI/CD pipeline configured for the project, so that code changes are automatically tested and deployed, ensuring quality and a fast feedback loop.**
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  A `.github/workflows/main.yml` file (or equivalent) is created.
        2.  The pipeline triggers on push to `main` and pull requests.
        3.  The pipeline includes steps for installing dependencies, running tests, and building the application.
        4.  The pipeline provides clear status feedback (pass/fail).

**Notes:**

*   This is the first sprint, and the focus is on getting the fundamental infrastructure in place.
*   Successful completion of this sprint will enable the team to work more efficiently and with higher confidence in the subsequent sprints.
