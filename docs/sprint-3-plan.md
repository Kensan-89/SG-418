# Sprint 3 Plan: Core Integrations & Unified View

**Sprint Goal:** Implement the core Canvas and Google Calendar integrations to provide a unified view of all tasks and events in the application.

**Selected Stories:**

*   **Story 2.1: Full Canvas Sync**
    *   As a logged-in user with a Canvas connection, I want the application to automatically sync all my courses and assignments, so that my agenda is always up-to-date with my academic workload without manual intervention.
*   **Story 2.2: Google Calendar Connection**
    *   As a logged-in user, I want to connect my Google Calendar, so that the application can access my calendar events.
*   **Story 2.3: Google Calendar Display**
    *   As a logged-in user with a Google Calendar connection, I want my calendar events to be displayed in the application, so that I can see all my commitments in one place.
*   **Story 2.4: Unified Agenda View**
    *   As a logged-in user, I want a unified "Agenda" view that shows both my tasks and calendar events in chronological order, so that I have a comprehensive overview of my daily commitments.
*   **Story 2.5: Weekly Planner View**
    *   As a logged-in user, I want a read-only "Weekly Planner" view that shows my tasks and events for the entire week, so that I can plan my week effectively.
*   **Story 2.6: Today Dashboard View**
    *   As a logged-in user, I want a "Today" dashboard that highlights tasks and events due on the current day, so that I can focus on my most immediate commitments.

**Notes:**

*   This sprint focuses on integrating external calendar and assignment data and presenting it in unified views.
*   Successful completion of this sprint will significantly enhance the application's core value proposition of providing a centralized view of all commitments.
