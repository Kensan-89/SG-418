# Sprint 4 Plan: Smart Scheduling & Productivity Tools

Status: Completed

**Sprint Goal:** Implement the core "smart" features of the application, including task prioritization, time tracking, and the "Find Free Time" algorithm, to enhance user productivity and scheduling.

**Selected Stories:**

*   **Story 3.1: Task Prioritization**
    *   As a logged-in user, I want to set a priority level (e.g., high, medium, low) for my tasks, so that I can visually distinguish and focus on what is most important.
*   **Story 3.2: Time Tracking for Tasks**
    *   As a logged-in user, I want to start and stop a timer for each task, so that I can track the actual time spent on my activities.
*   **Story 3.3: Define Preferred Study Times**
    *   As a logged-in user, I want to define my preferred study times in the settings, so that the "Find Free Time" feature can provide more relevant suggestions.
*   **Story 3.4: "Find Free Time" Algorithm (MVP)**
    *   As the system, I want to analyze the user's schedule (tasks, calendar events, preferred study times) and identify available "white space," so that I can suggest optimal time blocks for focused work.
*   **Story 3.5: Integrate "Find Free Time" in UI**
    *   As a logged-in user, I want to easily access and utilize the "Find Free Time" feature within the application, so that I can quickly schedule study blocks based on the system's suggestions.

**Notes:**

*   This sprint focuses on implementing the unique differentiating features of the application.
*   Successful completion of this sprint will bring the application closer to its core value proposition of intelligent time management.
