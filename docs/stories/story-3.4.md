**Story 3.4: "Find Free Time" Algorithm**

As a busy user,
I want the application to analyze my schedule and suggest available time slots for a specific task,
So that I can efficiently find and dedicate time for studying without manually scanning my calendar.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A "Find Free Time" button is available for each task.
2. When clicked, the system analyzes the user's calendar events and existing tasks.
3. It identifies and presents a list of "white space" slots that are large enough for the task (based on an estimated duration).
4. The suggestions are ranked based on the user's preferred study times.
5. The user can select a slot to schedule the task.

**Prerequisites:** Story 2.4, Story 3.3
